# React Boilerplate

This is a basic React boilerplate to help you kickstart your React projects, and most importantly - mine! Every time I start a new project, it takes at least 20 minutes setting everything up, and time is money. This basic boilerplate comes fully setup with SASS, Craco Alias (Because who likes the default way to import a component - not me!!), Routing, and state management using Recoil. I'm currently using Recoil-Nexus to be able to change state outside of a component - will probably switch this to something else in the future as Recoil Nexus is out of date.
